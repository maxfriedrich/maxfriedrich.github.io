<p>Facebook is an important communication tool to me. Most of my fellow students donâ€™t use iMessage or Twitter DMs, so we talk on Facebook. However, I seem not to be able to <em>just</em> check my messages on Facebook. Instead, I wind up scrolling through the News Feed for a couple of minutes each time I visit Facebook in the browser. I recently looked at about 30 News Feed posts in detail and discovered these three things:</p>

<ul><li>I didn&rsquo;t care about any of the posts that described activities on Facebook. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me if <code>$friend</code> changed their profile picture or liked someone else&rsquo;s status update.</li>
<li>I was interested in two link posts but I had already seen the exact same links on Twitter hours earlier.</li>
<li>People tend to create albums of mediocre photos on Facebook while they only post their best on Instagram. Many of my Facebook friends have Instagram accounts and I already follow the ones I&rsquo;m interested in.</li>
</ul><p>I concluded that I don&rsquo;t need to read the News Feed, so I wrote a custom stylesheet that hides it. This is the result:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using &ldquo;Quiet Facebook&rdquo; for a week now and I&rsquo;m happy with it, <a href="https://github.com/maxfriedrich/quiet-facebook">so I put the CSS on GitHub</a>. I just embed the stylesheet via Safari&rsquo;s settings but someone could certainly build browser extensions that load the stylesheet from <code>raw.github.com</code> and toggle it when the user clicks a button. Feel free to submit pull requests (or suggest a better name for the whole thing)!</p>

<p><strong>Update May 24:</strong> Chrome and Firefox users can install the stylesheet <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/128616/quiet-facebook-official">via Userstyles.org, using the Stylish extension</a>. Safari users: <a href="https://github.com/maxfriedrich/quiet-facebook">Download the CSS from GitHub</a>, open Safari Preferences, Advanced, select downloaded file in Style sheet dropdown.</p>
